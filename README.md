# LSTM-Based Stock Price Prediction

## 📌 Introduction
The **LSTM-Based Stock Price Prediction** system leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to predict stock prices based on historical data. This project aims to provide accurate forecasts for stock trends using deep learning.

## 🚀 Features
- 📈 **Time-Series Forecasting** – Predicts stock prices based on past trends.
- 🤖 **Deep Learning Model** – Utilizes LSTM for sequence prediction.
- 📊 **Data Visualization** – Interactive charts to analyze trends.
- 🏛️ **Historical Data Processing** – Cleans and preprocesses stock data.
- 🔍 **Real-Time Data Fetching** – Can be integrated with APIs for live stock data.
- 🎨 **User-Friendly Interface** – Displays predictions in an interactive manner.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- **Data Source:** Yahoo Finance API / Alpha Vantage API

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lstm-stock-prediction.git
   cd lstm-stock-prediction
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **Data Collection:** Fetch historical stock prices from Yahoo Finance.
2. **Preprocessing:** Normalize and structure the data for LSTM training.
3. **Model Training:** Train the LSTM model on past stock data.
4. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict future stock prices.
5. **Visualization:** Display predictions with interactive charts.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- ✅ Integrate real-time stock price API for dynamic predictions.
- 📊 Add multi-stock prediction capabilities.
- 🏆 Implement reinforcement learning for improved accuracy.
- 📉 Introduce risk analysis and trend detection.
